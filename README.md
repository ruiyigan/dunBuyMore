### Future Features
- Data Presentation (Your Household wastage Vs Average Singaporean Household wastage)
  - We have stored food_Status (consumed or disposed) and household_size in our database. 
  - Similar to our current electricity bills which shows household their energy consumption rate vs the community, we like to present this information with the data collected.
